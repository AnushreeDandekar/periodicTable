Periodic Table App  
-An interactive web application built with **Spring Boot** (backend) and **React** (frontend) that displays data for all 118 chemical elements.  
-Users can view different element properties and use a search bar to find specific elements by name.  

Note:
    This project is an attempt to understand how a Java Spring Boot backend can integrate with a React frontend in a full-stack web application.  
    It was built as a learning exercise to deepen my understanding of REST APIs, component rendering, and data flow between backend and frontend.  
    The application displays data for all 118 chemical elements using a React-based UI and a Spring Boot API that serves the element data from a JSON file.
